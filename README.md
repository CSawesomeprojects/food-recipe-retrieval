# food-recipe-retrieval
In our project, we introduce a model that  aims to learn embeddings of cooking recipes and food images that  yields notable results on image-recipe captioning task. Food is one of the most fundamental issus for humans, since it can affect every other aspects of our lives, like health, sleeping habits, feelings and culture. Therefore, we think automization of recipe-image retrieval can be a beneficial task that  makes cooking food easier. We propose a complex combined neural network that learns embeddings for ingredients, cooking instructions and food images through different joint models.  This domain is fairly new and we hope these embeddings provide a basis for further works on not only recipe-image retrieval task but also for other domains like computer vision.
